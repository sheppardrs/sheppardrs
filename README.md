Hey! 

I'm Sheppard Somers, currently working in data science and business experimentation with Mastercard. 
I have a BE in engineering, do some technical work in database setup and etl processes in SQL, and manage client teams 
guiding business experimentation from strategy to supply to pricing. 

I'm getting back into some coding work because I miss making tangible proucts! 

Shep
